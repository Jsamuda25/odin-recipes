        <h3> Ingredients (Sauce, Crust, Toppings)</h3>

        <h4> Sauce:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>(12 ounce) can CONTADINA Tomato Sauce</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon dried oregano, crushed</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon dried basil, crushed</li>
            <li> Half teaspoon garlic powder </li>
            <li> Half teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li> Half teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li> Half teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li> Half teaspoon salt</li>
            <li> Quarter teaspoon black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h4> Crust: </h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Three and a quarter cups of all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
            <li> 0.25 ounce of FLEISCHMANN'S Pizza Crust Yeast or RapidRise Yeast</li>
            <li> 1 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li> 1 and a half teaspoons salt</li>
            <li> One third cup of oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h4> Toppings: </h4>
        <ul> 
            <li> 6 ounce package HORMEL Pepperoni</li>
            <li> 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Steps</h3>
        <ol> 
            <li> For sauce: Combine all sauce ingredients with 1/2 cup water in a medium bowl; set aside for flavors to develop while making crust. Freeze remaining paste.</li>
            <li> For crusts: Combine 2 cups of flour with the dry yeast, sugar and salt. Add the water and oil and mix until well blended (about 1 minute). 
                Gradually add enough remaining flour slowly, until a soft, sticky dough ball is formed.</li>
            <li> Knead for about 4 minutes on a floureed surface, until dough is smooth and elastic. Add more flour, if needed. (If using RapidRise
                Yeast, let dough rest, covered, for 10 minutes.)</li>
            <li> Divide dough in half. Pat each half (with floured hands) into a 12-inch greased pizza pan OR roll dough to fit pans.</li>
            <li> For pizzas: Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Top crusts with sauce, pepperoni and cheese.</li>
            <li> Bake for 18 to 20 minutes until crusts are browned and cheese is bubbly. For best results, roate pizza pans between top and bottom oven racks halfway through baking</li>
        </ol>
